# php-integrator-autocomplete-plus

This package provides linting for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) as well as [linter](https://github.com/atom-community/linter).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

This package is not meant to be a replacement for existing PHP linters, but more as a complementary package that will indicate additional issues that the existing linters can't detect.

What is included?
  * Shows errors returned by the base service's indexing process.
